[ ] REMOVING CODE SMELL
	[ ] consider making most non-private fields private and adding getters and setters
	[ ] replace most extends classes with interfaces or leave the out all together
	[ ] try to go around getters and setters as much as possible
	[ ] all code should be as encapsulated as possible
	[ ] using a Pointer for x and y coordinates?
