Refactoring Ideas


package: level
	Keyboard
	Level
	LevelBackground

	CollisionController
	EnemyController
	BulletController
	WallController // this might become a "simple" wall class
	
	package characters
		CharacterInterface
		Boss
		Enemy
		Exogorth
		Player
		ENEMYTYPE
		
	package: FlyingObject
		Bullet
		Wall
		BULLETOWNER
		
		
Make sure that wallCollision is actually put into CollisionController and out of Player and Enemy
- both might have a border-collision function and use that
	basically:
	borderCollision(int currentXPosition)
		if currentX < Level.height/2
			whatever
			
		if currentX > Level.height/2
			something else
			
			
			
CollisionController should really only check for the intersects and then call the methods
	if(player.collides(enemy)
		enemy.hit
		player.hit
		
	if(player.collides(bullet)
		player.hit
		bullet.remove
		
	if(player.collides(wall)
		player.boundary
		player.hit
		
	if(enemy.collides.enemy)
		enemie1.changeDirection
		enemy2.changeDirection
		
	if enemy.collides(wall)
		enemy.changeDirection
	
	if(enemy.collides(bullet)
		if(bullet is his own)
			continue
		enemy.hit
		
		
		
alternative to enemy.collides(enemy):
	when creating the enemies, make sure that they are apart. e.g. one enemy every 100+-50 pixels. add this as a pattern in the enemy constrcutor
