[X] COLLISION
	Five Cases:
	[X] enemies colliding with border
		--> (both) change direction (simply turn around ySign)
	[X] bullet hits player
		--> bullet.remove()
		--> if(damageGracePeriod != still happening)
				player.lives--
				damageGracePeriod = restart
	[X] enemy collides with player
		--> enemy.remove()
		--> player.lives--
			damageGracePeriod = restart
	[X] player bullet hits enemy
		--> enemy.lives--
			if(enemy.lives == 0)

	[X] enemy bullet hits enemy
		--> enemy.lives--

[ ] REMOVING CODE SMELL
	[ ] consider making most non-private fields private and adding getters and setters
	[ ] replace most extends classes with interfaces or leave the out all together
	[ ] try to go around getters and setters as much as possible
	[ ] all code should be as encapsulated as possible
	[ ] using a Pointer for x and y coordinates?
